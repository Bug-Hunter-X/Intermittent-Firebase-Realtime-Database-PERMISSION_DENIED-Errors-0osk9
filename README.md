# Intermittent Firebase Realtime Database PERMISSION_DENIED Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firebase Realtime Database throws `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors inconsistently, even with seemingly correct security rules.  The issue is intermittent and challenging to debug.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.

**Problem:** The application attempts to read/write data from the database, but randomly encounters `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.  Security rules are reviewed and appear correct.

**Potential Causes:**
* **Rule Evaluation Timing:**  The timing of rule evaluation may be an issue.  The client's authentication status might not be fully established before attempting database operations. 
* **Caching Issues:**  Firebase client-side caching might cause stale data or permissions to be used.
* **Concurrency Problems:** Database rules might not handle concurrent updates perfectly.
* **Network Conditions:**  Transient network issues could disrupt the communication and lead to permission errors.

**Workaround (bugSolution.js):**  The solution involves using exponential backoff and retries to handle intermittent failures.  This allows the application to try again after delays when a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error occurs.
